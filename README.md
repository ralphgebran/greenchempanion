### *Your Python-based companion for Green Chemistry!*
A Practical Programming for Chemistry project by Marc A, Ralph G, Tais T, Valentine W. üá±üáß üá∫üá∏ üá´üá∑ üáßüá™

#### **GreenChemPanion**, or **GCP**, is a Python Package and Applet, based on RDKit and Streamlit, providing functions as well as an interface to compute Green Chemistry factors of a reaction or a molecule!

## üî• Features
GCP provides many functions helping to calculate Green Chemistry factors and analyse reactions. Most of them are centered around the main component of this package: the `Reaction` class!

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **The Reaction class**
This class helps organise chemical reactions in a form suited for programming. It has three components:
- A first dictionary for reactants `Dict[Mol:int]` containing molecules and their associated stoichiometric coefficients
- A second dictionary for products `Dict[Mol:int]` containing molecules and their associated stoichiometric coefficients
- An integer `int` representing the main product's index in the second dictionary, which is set to `0` by default
```python
from rdkit import Chem
from rdkit.Chem.rdchem import Mol
from greenchempanion import Reaction

# Methane Combustion
methane = Chem.MolFromSmiles("C")
dioxygen = Chem.MolFromSmiles("O=O")
carbon_dioxide = Chem.MolFromSmiles("O=C=O")
water = Chem.MolFromSmiles("O")

methane_comb = Reaction({methane: 1, dioxygen:2}, {carbon_dioxide:1, water:2})
# Carbon Dioxide is set as the main product
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Preliminary functions**
Two smaller-scale functions are present, which are used in the more significant operations:
- `Atom_Count_With_H(compound: Mol)` : Takes a Mol object as an argument, and gives the total count of all atoms in the compound, including the hydrogen atoms (unlike RDKit's `GetNumAtoms` method which, on its own, always assumes a given Mol is counted without its H atoms)
```python
from greenchempanion import Atom_Count_With_H

# RDKit GetNumAtoms
print(methane.GetNumAtoms()) # Output should be 1
# GCP Atom_Count_With_H
print(Atom_Count_With_H(methane)) # Output should be 5
```

- `canonicalize_smiles(smiles: string)` : Takes a SMILES format string as input, and outputs the canonicalized SMILES format as a string.
```python
from greenchempanion import canonicalize_smiles

print(canonicalize_smiles("C(C)O")) # Output should be CCO
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Atom Economy (methods of the `Reaction` class)**
Two methods are programmed into the `Reaction` class, which output atom economy:

- `Atom_Economy_A` : Atom Economy based on the number of atoms 

Numerical Operation: `[Number of atoms in Main Product / Number of atoms in Reactants] * 100`
```python
print(methane_comb.Atom_Economy_A()) # Output should be 33.33 %
```

- `Atom_Economy_M` : Atom Economy based on molar masses 

Numerical Operation: `[Molar Mass of Main Product / Molar Mass of Reactants] * 100`
```python
print(methane_comb.Atom_Economy_M()) # Output should be 55 %
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **PMI and E-Factor Functions**
The two Green Chemistry factors are present as functions, which take three arguments:
- A GCP `Reaction`
- A dictionary for extras, such as solvents or extraction material `Dict[Mol:float]` containing molecules and their masses in grams, per kilogram of main product
- The main product's yield, as a `float`

```python
from greenchempanion import compute_PMI, compute_E

# Compounds of a SN reaction
sodium_azide = Chem.MolFromSmiles("[N-]=[N+]=[N-].[Na+]")
two_iodobutane = Chem.MolFromSmiles("CCC(I)C")
two_azidobutane = Chem.MolFromSmiles("CCC([N]=[N+]=[N-])C")
sodium_iodide = Chem.MolFromSmiles("[Na+].[I-]")

# Solvent and Extraction compounds
acetone = Chem.MolFromSmiles("CC(=O)C")
ether = Chem.MolFromSmiles("CCOCC")

sn_reaction = Reaction({two_iodobutane:1, sodium_azide:1}, {two_azidobutane:1, sodium_iodide:1})
sn_extras = {acetone:17470, water:112000, ether:81800}

# The two functions !
sn_reaction_pmi = compute_PMI(sn_reaction, sn_extras , 0.9)
sn_reaction_e= compute_E(sn_reaction, sn_extras, 0.9)
```

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£üÖ∞Ô∏è **PMI: `compute_PMI`**
The Process Mass Index, or PMI, measures the amount of materials used in a given reaction, per kilogram of main product (accounting for the yield).

Numerical Operation: `Mass of Reactants per kg of Main Product + Mass of Extras per kg of Main Product`

```python
print(sn_reaction_pmi) # Output should be 214
```

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£üÖ±Ô∏è **E-Factor: `compute_E`**
The E-Factor measures the amount of waste produced by a given reaction, per kilogram of main product (accounting for the yield).

Numerical Operation: `Mass of Side Products per kg of Main Product + Mass of Extras per kg of Main Product`

```python
print(sn_reaction_e) # Output should be 212.9
```


## üë©‚Äçüíª Installation

First start by cloning the GCP Repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/ralphgebran/greenchempanion
```

Then, install the environement containing all GreenChemPanion dependencies:

- If you are on Windows ü™ü:
```
conda env create -f env_win.yml
```

- If you are on Mac üçè:
```
conda env create -f env_mac.yml
```

Activate the environment
```
conda activate gcp
```

If you need jupyter lab, install it 

```
(gcp) $ pip install jupyterlab
```

## üåê Streamlit Applet
In the `src/greenchempanion/` folder of the repository, the `app.py` is present, containing the interactive applet.

Make sure your terminal is located in the `src` folder
```
cd "YourRepoLocation"/src/greenchempanion
```

Run the applet
```
streamlit run app.py
```

The applet should open on local tab in your default browser. Feel free to experiment with the different sections, which showcase the GCP fuctionalities!

## üõ†Ô∏è Development installation

Initialize Git (only for the first time). 

Note: You should have create an empty repository on `https://github.com:ralphgebran/greenchempanion`.

```
git init
git add * 
git add .*
git commit -m "Initial commit" 
git branch -M main
git remote add origin git@github.com:ralphgebran/greenchempanion.git 
git push -u origin main
```

Then add and commit changes as usual. 

To install the package, run

```
(greenchempanion) $ pip install -e ".[test,doc]"
```

### Run tests and coverage

```
(conda_env) $ pip install tox
(conda_env) $ tox
```
