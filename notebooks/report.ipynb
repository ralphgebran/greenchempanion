    "**About This Notebook:**\n",
    "The principles of Green Chemistry seek to transform the way chemical processes are designed, with the goal of reducing or eliminating the use and generation of dangerous substances. Sustainable chemistry insists on improving reaction efficiency, minimizing waste, and ensuring the long-term safety of both products and processes. Key metrics such as the E-Factor, Process Mass Intensity (PMI), and Atom Economy have been developed to quantitatively measure the environmental impact of chemical reactions. Also, solvent choice and product properties are key to assessing the sustainability of chemical transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this context, we have developed GreenChemPanion, an interactive Python-based platform designed to help chemists assess and optimize the sustainability of their reactions. GreenChemPanion integrates core green chemistry metrics. It includes the E-Factor, PMI, and Atom Economy, together with evaluations of solvent sustainability, molecular greenness (based on atomic composition), and reaction conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The platform allows users to input key reaction parameters such as reactants, products, solvents, and catalysts. It then automatically computes sustainability scores, classifies solvents according to established green chemistry guidelines, analyzes molecular structures for environmentally concerning elements, and provides a comprehensive \"green grade\" for the reaction. In addition to offering quantitative feedback, GreenChemPanion highlights areas where improvements can be made to align more closely with sustainable practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this project, we aim to provide chemists with a centralized, intuitive, and practical tool that supports greener decision-making. GreenChemPanion bridges the gap between synthetic chemistry and green chemistry principles, helping users evaluate their current reactions and design more sustainable processes following the 12 Principles of Green Chemistry.\n",
    "\n",
    "**üöÄ Getting started:**\n",
    "To get started, simply follow the structure outlined in the ReadMe. Each part of the project includes clear explanations, illustrative code examples, and visual outputs to help you understand and apply the concepts efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to use:**\n",
    "Feel free to modify the inputs, test different reactions, and explore how different molecular structures impact sustainability metrics. The code is modular and documented to support experimentation and learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Questions?**\n",

    "\n",
    "### **üß™ Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "GreenChemPanion is an interactive notebook designed to assess the environmental sustainability of chemical reactions based on the principles of green chemistry. It is based on the analysis of indicators such as atom economy, E-factor, solvent use, and the nature of the products generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **üéØ Motivations**\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is aimed at anyone, students, teachers, or researchers, who wishes to integrate sustainability concepts from the design phase of a chemical synthesis. By offering a rapid, visual, and multi-criteria assessment of a reaction based on its SMILES representation, GreenChemPanion makes it possible to identify the main weak points of a transformation from a green chemistry perspective in just a few seconds. Using various indicators (atom savings, waste generated, nature of solvents, atomic elements present, molecular structure of the product), the project encourages a more critical and responsible approach to chemistry.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond the technical aspect, GreenChemPanion is also intended as an educational and awareness-raising tool. It reminds us that every choice made during a synthesis‚Äîfrom the solvent to the product formed‚Äîcan have a measurable environmental impact. By facilitating access to criteria often considered secondary in laboratory planning, this project contributes to making sustainable chemistry a concrete, accessible, and applicable priority starting in university education.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **üåü Main Features**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Atom Economy Calculation**: Measures the efficiency with which reactants are converted into the main product.\n",
    "E-Factor & PMI: Evaluate the mass of waste generated and the mass of material consumed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Solvent Assessment**: Classifies solvents into three categories (\"Green\", \"Acceptable\", \"Bad\") according to their environmental impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **LogP Analysis**: Provides an indication of the product's biodegradability and persistence in a biological environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Elemental Risk Scan**: Detects the presence of problematic elements (heavy metals, halogens, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Structural Assessment**: Searches for structural motifs associated with environmental risks or toxicity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Streamlit Interface**: Interactive interface for easily testing different reactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **üìâ Challenges Encountered**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Stoichiometry and balancing**: The code had to ensure that the reactions were well balanced before running the calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reliable atom counting**: Implicit hydrogens had to be taken into account to obtain a realistic count.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Choice of reference solvents**: The classification of solvents was based on an arbitrary selection of representative SMILES, which sometimes required questionable decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Product evaluation**: Certain criteria (such as logP or the presence of \"at risk\" atoms) may vary depending on the application context, which introduces a degree of subjectivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Using Streamlit**: Integrating it into a dynamic interface while maintaining explicit and colorful user feedback required technical adjustments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **üöß Limitations**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Subjectivity in some criteria**: The evaluation of problematic solvents or structures is based on lists chosen by the developers, which may not cover all cases or depend on questionable sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **SMILES only**: Some complex or ambiguous reactions cannot be properly analyzed if the SMILES are not well written or ambiguous.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Simplification of waste**: All products that are not the main product are considered waste, which can be reductive in the case of recoverable co-products.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Lack of energy factors**: The software does not take into account experimental conditions (such as temperature and pressure) which also influence durability.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Limit to one reaction at a time**: The system evaluates only one transformation at a time and does not yet allow a global evaluation of a multi-step synthetic route.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **‚úÖ Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "GreenChemPanion represents a first step toward an interactive and accessible green chemistry assistant. While still imperfect, it allows for an initial assessment of chemical transformations from a sustainability perspective. By combining various indicators in a simple interface, it serves as an educational tool and awareness-raising tool. The project remains open to future expansions: consideration of energy, multi-step approach, reaction database, or even the integration of artificial intelligence for more refined recommendations.\n",
